I am a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford ICME. My current research interest lies in machine learning thoery, in particular Federated Learning, Optimization and Deep Learning theory. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Tengyu Ma](https://ai.stanford.edu/~tengyuma/).

Before coming to Stanford, I graduated from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn) with B.S. degrees in Computational Mathematics and Computer Science.
